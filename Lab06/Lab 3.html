          Beneath the fading glow of the evening sky, the small town seemed to hold its breath. A gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming jasmine through the narrow streets. Children’s laughter echoed faintly from a distant park, mingling with the rhythmic chirping of crickets. Old street lamps flickered to life, casting long shadows on cobblestone paths. Somewhere, a dog barked lazily, as if announcing the arrival of night. The bakery on the corner closed its doors, but the warmth of fresh bread still lingered in the air. A lone cyclist pedaled past, his headlight cutting a thin beam through the growing darkness. In the square, a fountain whispered softly, its water catching the last traces of sunlight. Above, the first stars began to appear, shy yet certain in their glow. The town, wrapped in quiet, seemed ready to dream.
