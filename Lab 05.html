            The quiet hum of the city at dusk carried a rhythm that felt almost alive. Streetlights flickered on one by one, painting golden halos across the pavement as people hurried home, their footsteps blending into a chorus of everyday life.

It was the kind of moment that seemed ordinary yet held a subtle magic—an invitation to pause, breathe, and notice the small details that often slip by unnoticed.
